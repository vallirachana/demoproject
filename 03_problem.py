# Boss Fight
"""
You are given a list of integers fighters and a two dimensional list bosses. The fighters list contains 1s and 0s with a 1 representing a fighter. Similarly, each bosses list contains 1s and 0s with a 1 representing a boss.

Given that fighters can beat a bosses row if it contains more fighters than bosses, return a new bosses matrix with defeated boss rows removed.

Example 1
Input

fighters = [0, 1, 1]
bosses = [[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1]]
Output

[[0, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1]]
Explanation

There's 2 fighters so is able to beat [0, 0, 0] and [0, 0, 1] bosses.
